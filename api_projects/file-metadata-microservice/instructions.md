# File Metadata Microservice
Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://file-metadata-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks.

### Hint
You can use the multer npm package to handle file uploading.

### Tests
- You can submit a form that includes a file upload.
- The form file input field has the name attribute set to upfile.
- When you submit a file, you receive the file name, type, and size in bytes within the JSON response.
